The problem involves calculating the distance matrix generated by the Jukes Cantor method. But only values lower than 4% would be taken into account, the rest would be discarded. As the number of combinations of the sequences was large but many data would be discarded, instead of generating a square matrix of distance (that would be a sparse matrix in this case), I stored the data in an object of a class I created. So there would be no wasted memory space.
Since the equation cannot have p values greater than 3/4, nor sequence size equal to zero, when this happens I assign the distance between these sequences an infinite value (that exist in the numpy library of python), so they will be discarded when pass through the restriction that distance value has to be less than 4%. The generated results were placed in the CSV file called "output_matrix.csv", which shows the distance between each sequence pair.
